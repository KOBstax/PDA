Phenomenon Description Analyzer 

The Phenomenon Description Analyzer (PDA) has been researched and created in order to allow people without a background in simulations to have a description of their phenomenon separated into the components of an agent-based model (ABM). In order to implement this technology, IBMâ€™s Watson Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and Knowledge Studio were used alongside each other in order to extract entities from unstructured descriptions of phenomenons.
