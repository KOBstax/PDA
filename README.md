Phenomenon Description Analyzer 

The Phenomenon Description Analyzer (PDA) has been researched and created in order to allow people without a background in simulations to have a description of their phenomenon separated into the components of an agent-based model (ABM). In order to implement this technology, IBMâ€™s Watson Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and Knowledge Studio were used alongside each other in order to extract entities from unstructured descriptions of phenomenons. 

In order too run the PDA_API code youll need python three along with visual studio tools. https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/dev-essentials/#dev-tools 

To run your own model just change the username, password to your own given through IBM Watsons NLU and the model ID recieved through Knowledge Studio. 

Recently the username password has changed to an APIKey it will be commented next to user name and password with the correct format if you are using an API key also received from NLU.
